== Overview

nanoc is a simple but very flexible static site generator written in Ruby.
It operates on local files, and therefore does not run on the server. nanoc
"compiles" the local source files into HTML (usually), by evaluating eRuby,
Markdown, etc.

== Documentation

nanoc's web site, which can be found at http://nanoc.stoneship.org, contains a
few useful resources to help you get started with nanoc:

* The tutorial at http://nanoc.stoneship.org/help/tutorial
* The manual at http://nanoc.stoneship.org/help/manual

It is probably also worth checking out and perhaps subscribing to the
discussion groups:

* The discussion group in English at http://groups.google.com/group/nanoc
* The discussion group in Spanish at http://groups.google.com/group/nanoc-es

=== Source Code Documentation

The source code is structured in a few directories:

* *bin* contains the commandline tool aptly named +nanoc+
* *lib*
  * *nanoc*
    * *base* contains the bare essentials necessary for nanoc to function
    * *cli* contains the commandline interface
    * *data_sources* contains the standard data sources (Nanoc::DataSource
      subclasses), such as the filesystem data source
    * *helpers* contains helpers, which provide functionality some sites
      may find useful, such as the blogging and tagging helpers
    * *extra* contains stuff that is not needed by nanoc itself, but which may
      be used by helpers, data sources, filters or routers.
    * *filters* contains the standard filters (Nanoc::Filter subclasses) such
      as ERB, Markdown, Haml, ...
    * *routers* contains the standard routers (Nanoc::Router subclasses)
* *test* contains test fixtures as well as testing code, structured in the
  same way as lib/nanoc

The namespaces (modules) are organised like this:

* *Nanoc* is the namespace for everything nanoc-related (obviously). The
  classes in 'lib/nanoc/base' are part of this module (not Nanoc::Base which
  does not exist)
  * *CLI* containing everything related to the commandline tool.
  * *DataSources* contains the data sources
  * *Helpers* contains the helpers
  * *Extra* contains useful stuff not needed by nanoc itself
  * *Filters* contains the (textual) filters
  * *Routers* contains the routers

The central class in nanoc is Nanoc::Site, so you should start there if you
want to explore nanoc from a technical perspective.
