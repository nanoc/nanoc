Reporting bugs
--------------

If you find a bug in Nanoc, you should report it! Some information that you should include in your bug report is the Nanoc version (`nanoc --version`) and, if relevant, the crash log (`crash.log`).

For details, check the [*bug reporting* section of the development guide](http://nanoc.ws/development/#reporting-bugs).

Contributing code
-----------------

Pull requests are appreciated! When submitting a PR, be sure to submit it onto the right branch:

* For bug fixes, use the release branch, e.g. `release-3.6.x`
* For features, use the `master` branch

When submitting a PR, make sure that your changes have covering tests, that the documentation remains up-to-date and that you retain backwards compatibility.
