module Nanoc3

  # Nanoc3::Filter is responsible for filtering items. It is the superclass
  # for all textual filters.
  #
  # A filter instance should only be used once. Filters should not be reused
  # since they store state.
  #
  # When creating a filter with a hash containing assigned variables, those
  # variables will be made available in the `@assigns` instance variable and
  # the {#assigns} method. The assigns itself will also be available as
  # instance variables and instance methods.
  #
  # @example Accessing assigns in different ways
  #
  #   filter = SomeFilter.new({ :foo => 'bar' })
  #   filter.instance_eval { @assigns[:foo] }
  #     # => 'bar'
  #   filter.instance_eval { assigns[:foo] }
  #     # => 'bar'
  #   filter.instance_eval { @foo }
  #     # => 'bar'
  #   filter.instance_eval { foo }
  #     # => 'bar'
  #
  # @abstract Subclass and override {#run} to implement a custom filter.
