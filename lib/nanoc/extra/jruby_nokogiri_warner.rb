--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note:

The behavior of Pure Java Nokogiri differs from the Nokogiri used on the
standard Ruby interpreter (MRI) due to differences in underlying libraries.

These sometimes problematic behavioral differences can cause nanoc filters not
to function properly, if at all. If you need reliable (X)HTML and XML handling
functionality, consider not using Nokogiri on JRuby for the time being.

These issues are being worked on both from the Nokogiri and the nanoc side. Keep
your Nokogiri and nanoc versions up to date!
