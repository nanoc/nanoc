module Nanoc::DataSources

  # The static data source provides items from a single directory. Unlike the
  # filesystem data sources, static provides no additional item metadata. In
  # addition, all items are treated as 'binary', regardless of their extension
  # or content. As such, it is most useful for simple assets, not for normal
  # content.
  #
  # The identifier for static items is the full item path. For example, if your
  # static data source item_root is `static`, an item named `foo.css` would have
  # the identifier `/static/foo.css/`. Note that, unlike the filesystem data
  # sources, `foo/index.html` and `foo.yaml` receive no special treatment. They
  # are simple static items, just like `foo.css`.
  #
  # The default data source directory is `static/`, but this can be overridden
  # in the data source configuration:
  #
  #    data_sources:
  #      - type:   static
  #        prefix: assets
  #
  # Unless the `hide_items` configuration attribute is false, items from static
  # data sources will have the :is_hidden attribute set by default, which will
  # exclude them from the Blogging helper's atom feed generator, among other
  # things.
