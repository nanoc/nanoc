module Nanoc

  # filesystem, such as checksums, cached compiled content and dependency
  # graphs.

  # Each store has a version number. When attempting to load data from a store
  # that has an incompatible version number, no data will be loaded, but
  # {#version_mismatch_detected} will be called.

  # @abstract Subclasses must implement {#data} and {#data=}, and may
  #   implement {#no_data_found} and {#version_mismatch_detected}.
