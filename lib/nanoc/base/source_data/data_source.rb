module Nanoc

  # Responsible for loading site data. It is the (abstract) superclass for all
  # data sources. Subclasses must at least implement the data reading methods
  # ({#items} and {#layouts}); all other methods involving data manipulation
  # are optional.
  #
  # Apart from the methods for loading and storing data, there are the {#up}
  # and {#down} methods for bringing up and tearing down the connection to the
  # data source. These should be overridden in subclasses. The {#loading}
  # method wraps {#up} and {#down}. {#loading} is a convenience method for the
  # more low-level methods {#use} and {#unuse}, which respectively increment
  # and decrement the reference count; when the reference count goes from 0 to
  # 1, the data source will be loaded ({#up} will be called) and when the
  # reference count goes from 1 to 0, the data source will be unloaded
  # ({#down} will be called).
  #
  # The {#setup} method is used for setting up a site's data source for the
  # first time.
  #
  # @abstract Subclasses should at least implement {#items} and {#layouts}. If
  #   the data source should support creating items and layouts using the
  #   `create_item` and `create_layout` CLI commands, the {#setup},
  #   {#create_item} and {#create_layout} methods should be implemented as
  #   well.
