module Nanoc
  # Provides a way to send notifications between objects. It allows blocks
  # associated with a certain notification name to be registered; these blocks
  # will be called when the notification with the given name is posted.
  #
  # It is a slightly different implementation of the Observer pattern; the
  # table of subscribers is not stored in the observable object itself, but in
  # the notification center.

      # the notification with the given name is received.

      #   cause the given block to be called.

      #   the given notification block from being unregistered.
