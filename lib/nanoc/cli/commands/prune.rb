usage       'prune'
summary     'remove files not managed by nanoc from the output directory'
description <<-EOS
Find all files in the output directory that do not correspond to an item
managed by nanoc and remove them. Since this is a hazardous operation, an
additional `--yes` flag is needed as confirmation.

Also see the `auto_prune` configuration option in `nanoc.yaml` (`config.yaml`
for older nanoc sites), which will automatically prune after compilation.
