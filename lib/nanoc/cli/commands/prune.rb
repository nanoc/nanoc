usage 'prune'
summary 'remove files not managed by Nanoc from the output directory'
description <<-EOS
Find all files in the output directory that do not correspond to an item
managed by Nanoc and remove them. Since this is a hazardous operation, an
additional `--yes` flag is needed as confirmation.

Also see the `auto_prune` configuration option in `nanoc.yaml` (`config.yaml`
for older Nanoc sites), which will automatically prune after compilation.
